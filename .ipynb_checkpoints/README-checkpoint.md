# Exploring Hurricane Flooding Risk

When hurricanes strike the Texas coast, they often cause river flooding in three primary East Texas river basins, (Brazos, Trinity, and Neches). The goal of this project was to explore whether the tracks of different hurricanes as they approached the coast contributed to their river flooding impacts. 

I gathered meteorological data for the 19 hurricanes that droppd rain on East Texas between 2005 and 2021 and classified them into three track-based groups:

* Northeast (NE) - Track generally northward, east of Houston
* Northwest (NW) - Track generally northward, west of Houston
* Drag - Track "drags" along the coast

The figure below shows the three river basins as well as an example of a hurricane from each of the three track-based groupings.

The other three maps (from [here](https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=4.33/31.38/-100.08&search=eyJzZWFyY2hTdHJpbmciOiJUZXhhcywgVVNBIiwic2VhcmNoVHlwZSI6Imdlb2NvZGVkIiwib3NtSUQiOiIxMTQ2OTAiLCJjYXRlZ29yaWVzIjpbIkg1IiwiSDQiLCJIMyIsIkgyIiwiSDEiLCJUUyIsIlREIiwiRVQiXSwieWVhcnMiOltdLCJtb250aHMiOltdLCJlbnNvIjpbXSwicHJlc3N1cmUiOnsicmFuZ2UiOlswLDEwMzBdLCJpbmNsdWRlVW5rbm93blByZXNzdXJlIjp0cnVlfSwiYnVmZmVyIjo2MCwiYnVmZmVyVW5pdCI6WyJOYXV0aWNhbCBNaWxlcyJdLCJzb3J0U2VsZWN0aW9uIjp7InZhbHVlIjoieWVhcnNfbmV3ZXN0IiwibGFiZWwiOiJZZWFyIChOZXdlc3QpIn0sImFwcGx5VG9BT0kiOnRydWUsImlzU3Rvcm1MYWJlbHNWaXNpYmxlIjp0cnVlfQ==)) show an example from each primary hurricane track grouping.*
